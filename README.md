# kafka-avro
Kafka and Apache Avro

2. **Avro part (60 points)**
 - In this task, you need to create a Kafka producer and consumer using Avro to serialize messages.
 - Create a simple Kafka producer that sends a simple message to a topic serializing it using Avro.
 - Create a simple Kafka consumer which listens to a topic for a message, deserializes the message, and prints it.
 - Start Kafka, create a topic, and run consumer and producer.
 - Try to use different Avro schemas for serialization and deserialization. Observe that
schema version/id has changed e.g. in schema registry and kafka message payload(bytes 1-4).
